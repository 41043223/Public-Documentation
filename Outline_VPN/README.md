After installation you will get a apiUrl and it will tell you which port should be open

```sh
{"apiUrl":"https://123.456.789.123:65497/aqsOSwutrxM9pfz6t-FsVg","certSha256":"AFEA6F973CCCF11B5D223A29F2A4F26265B446A57EF6DBF4C59E5C41671EE20D"}

You wonâ€™t be able to access it externally, despite your server being correctly
set up, because there's a firewall (in this machine, your router or cloud
provider) that is preventing incoming connections to ports 65497 and 59549.

Make sure to open the following ports on your firewall, router or cloud provider:
- Management port 65497, for TCP
- Access key port 59549, for TCP and UDP
```
