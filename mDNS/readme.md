## mDNS

mDNS only can be used in LAN, it is convinced for you, when are in a DHCP network, in the network you have a server, but you don't have static IP to connect, in past, you may enter routers's dashboard to find IP, but now if you have mDNS, you can use a static socket address like ```raspberrypi.local``` to access your server
