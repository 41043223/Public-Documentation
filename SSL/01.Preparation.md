In this case we don't have Domain Name and want to use free SSL certificates service, 
so we choose NOIP and ZeroSSL to hold our server

Common DDNS provider:

1. <a href="https://www.noip.com/"> NOIP </a>


Common Free SSL certificates provider:

1. <a href="https://zerossl.com/"> ZeroSSL </a>

This manual we use NOIP and ZeroSSL for example


The first step is signup and login NOIP and ZeroSSL
